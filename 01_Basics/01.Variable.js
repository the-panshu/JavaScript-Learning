const Number=21
var Name="Deepanshu"
let Email="rajdeep@gmail.com"
City="Kanpur"
let Academy; //Value is not defined then it store it with "Undefined"

//Number=22 
// NUmber is Constant So we can not change it

//Printing using Console.log
console.log(Number)
console.log(Name)
console.log(Email)

// Better Approach to use Console in One Go....
console.table([Number , Name , Email])
